# Simulation & Forecasting Team
* What will you be doing?
* Generate Test Catalog - 100 years
* Generate a longer catalog
	* The longer the catalog the better. 
	* Can we generate a 2M year old catalog?
	* Some people will be in charge of running these things 
	* on the super computer. 
* Analyis part
* Writing code at the algorithmic level, how do we calculate \n the conjunction of the data
* calculating the probabilities of the drought. 
* Comparing with USERF3 (it's a different model).

# Machine Learning Team
* Brief introduction to machine learning algorithms: 
	* A machine is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 
* Types of Machine Learning: 
	* Supervised Learning: 
		* Based on input and output (predict if it's a boy or girl based on weight, height). 
		* Classification, or resgression. 
	* Unsupervised learning: 
		* typically reserved for REALLY huge data sets. 
		* imagine you have a giant social network like facebook.  That is a good use of unsupervised. 

## Classification problems (supervised). 
* "if you have pictures of these flowers, can you tell me wherther these are roses, tulips, etc.."
* We'll be applying these concepts to earthquake data. 
## Regression 
* approximates a mapping from input variables X to continuous output variables y. 

## What will you do on the Machine LEarning Team? 
* 1. Start data
* 2. SPlit data
	* Testing data set
	* training the data set
		* If your data is trash your results will be trash 
	
### What is the goal? 
* USe machine-learning neural networks to craete earthquake forecasts using RSQSim data as trainng catalogs. 

* Tpo my knowlege, there are few published works on using machine learning to forecast earthquakes. 
* If you want the right answer, you need to ask the right question. * If you ask a question that has a narrow focus, your answer will likely be better. 
* Simulation team will be generating the data that we will be working on.
# Tasks
* Determine at least three different ways to represent the state of RSQsim in the context of earthquake 

# Helpful skills
* Previous knowledge / experience with Machine LEarning 
* Mathmatical intuition
* Programming skills (esp python)
* Background in probability and statistics.
